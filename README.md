This is my version of the Klipper image for the Biqu Hurakan 3d printer unchanged.

It contains all the updates (original repos up to 04/12/2022), crowsnest, sonar, print area bed mesh and my firmware version.

For the ones only looking for the firmware files, they are also shared.
There are somme modifications and additions to the original one provided by Biqu.

Also, my superslicer profile is shared.

Hope it helps.
Enjoy.
