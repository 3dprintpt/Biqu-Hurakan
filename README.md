This is my version of the Klipper Firmware for the Biqu Hurakan 3d printer unchanged (stock).

If you want the built image ready to flash, check <a href="https://github.com/3dprintpt/Biqu-Hurakan/releases">Releases</a>.

If you just want the configuration files, download them from above (you will need some updates and to install sme things for it to work).

Also, my superslicer profile is shared.

Hope it helps.
Enjoy.
