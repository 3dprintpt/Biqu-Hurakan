This is my version of Klipper Firmware for the Biqu Hurakan 3d printer unchanged (stock).

If you want the built image ready to flash, check <a href="https://github.com/3dprintpt/Biqu-Hurakan/releases">Releases</a>.
It comes fully updated to the date of release and with some addons not installed on the stock system.

If you just want the configuration files, download them from above (you will need some updates and to install some things for it to work correctly).
Clean all files from "config" folder and paste this ones there (there is no need for mainsail.cfg).

Also, my superslicer profile is shared.

Hope it helps.
Enjoy.
